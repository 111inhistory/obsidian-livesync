### 0.16.0
- Now hidden files need not be scanned. Changes will be detected automatically.
  - If you want it to back to its previous behaviour, please disable `Monitor changes to internal files`.
  - Due to using an internal API, this feature may become unusable with a major update. If this happens, please disable this once.

#### Minors

- 0.16.1 Added missing log updates.
- 0.16.2 Fixed many problems caused by combinations of `Sync On Save` and the tracking logic that changed at 0.15.6.
- 0.16.3
  - Fixed detection of IBM Cloudant (And if there are some issues, be fixed automatically).
  - A configuration information reporting tool has been implemented.
- 0.16.4 Fixed detection failure. Please set the `Chunk size` again when using a self-hosted database.
- 0.16.5
  - Fixed
    - Conflict detection and merging now be able to treat deleted files.
    - Logs while the boot-up sequence has been tidied up.
    - Fixed incorrect log entries.
  - New Feature
    - The feature of automatically deleting old expired metadata has been implemented.
    We can configure it in `Delete old metadata of deleted files on start-up` in the `General Settings` pane.
- 0.16.6
  - Fixed
    - Automatic (temporary) batch size adjustment has been restored to work correctly.
    - Chunk splitting has been backed to the previous behaviour for saving them correctly.
  - Improved
    - Corrupted chunks will be detected automatically.
    - Now on the case-insensitive system, `aaa.md` and `AAA.md` will be treated as the same file or path at applying changesets.
- 0.16.7 Nothing has been changed except toolsets, framework library, and as like them. Please inform me if something had been getting strange!
- 0.16.8 Now we can synchronise without `bad_request:invalid UTF-8 JSON` even while end-to-end encryption has been disabled.

Note:
Before 0.16.5, LiveSync had some issues making chunks. In this case, synchronisation had became been always failing after a corrupted one should be made. After 0.16.6, the corrupted chunk is automatically detected. Sorry for troubling you but please do `rebuild everything` when this plug-in notified so.

### 0.15.0
- Outdated configuration items have been removed. 
- Setup wizard has been implemented!

I appreciate for reviewing and giving me advice @Pouhon158!

#### Minors
- 0.15.1 Missed the stylesheet.
- 0.15.2 The wizard has been improved and documented!
- 0.15.3 Fixed the issue about locking/unlocking remote database while rebuilding in the wizard.
- 0.15.4 Fixed issues about asynchronous processing (e.g., Conflict check or hidden file detection)
- 0.15.5 Add new features for setting Self-hosted LiveSync up more easier.
- 0.15.6 File tracking logic has been refined.
- 0.15.7 Fixed bug about renaming file.
- 0.15.8 Fixed bug about deleting empty directory, weird behaviour on boot-sequence on mobile devices.
- 0.15.9 Improved chunk retrieving, now chunks are retrieved in batch on continuous requests.
- 0.15.10 Fixed:
  - The boot sequence has been corrected and now boots smoothly.
  - Auto applying of batch save will be processed earlier than before.

### 0.14.1
- The target selecting filter was implemented.
  Now we can set what files are synchronised by regular expression.
- We can configure the size of chunks.
  We can use larger chunks to improve performance.
  (This feature can not be used with IBM Cloudant)
-  Read chunks online.
  Now we can synchronise only metadata and retrieve chunks on demand. It reduces local database size and time for replication.
- Added this note.
- Use local chunks in preference to remote them if present,

#### Recommended configuration for Self-hosted CouchDB
- Set chunk size to around 100 to 250 (10MB - 25MB per chunk)
- *Set batch size to 100 and batch limit to 20 (0.14.2)*
- Be sure to `Read chunks online` checked.

#### Minors
- 0.14.2 Fixed issue about retrieving files if synchronisation has been interrupted or failed
- 0.14.3 New test items have been added to `Check database configuration`.
- 0.14.4 Fixed issue of importing configurations.
- 0.14.5 Auto chunk size adjusting implemented.
- 0.14.6 Change Target to ES2018
- 0.14.7 Refactor and fix typos.
- 0.14.8 Refactored again. There should be no change in behaviour, but please let me know if there is any.

### 0.13.0

- The metadata of the deleted files will be kept on the database by default. If you want to delete this as the previous version, please turn on `Delete metadata of deleted files.`. And, if you have upgraded from the older version, please ensure every device has been upgraded.
- Please turn on `Delete metadata of deleted files.` if you are using livesync-classroom or filesystem-livesync.
- We can see the history of deleted files.
- `Pick file to show` was renamed to `Pick a file to show.
- Files in the `Pick a file to show` are now ordered by their modified date descent.
- Update information became to be shown on the major upgrade.

#### Minors
- 0.13.1 Fixed on conflict resolution.
- 0.13.2 Fixed file deletion failures.
- 0.13.4
  - Now, we can synchronise hidden files that conflicted on each devices.
  - We can search for conflicting docs.
  - Pending processes can now be run at any time.
  - Performance improved on synchronising large numbers of files at once.
