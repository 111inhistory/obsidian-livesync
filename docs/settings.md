# Settings of Self-hosted LiveSync

There are many settings in Self-hosted LiveSync. This document describes each setting in detail (not how-to). Configuration and settings are divided into several categories and indicated by icons. The icon is as follows:

Setup the Self-hosted LiveSync with the `setup URI` which is [copied from another device](#copy-current-settings-as-a-new-setup-uri) or the setup script.

#### Minimal setup

Step-by-step setup for Self-hosted LiveSync. You can setup Self-hosted LiveSync manually with Minimal setting items.

#### Enable LiveSync on this device as the setup was completed manually

This button only appears when the setup was not completed. If you have completed the setup manually, you can enable LiveSync on this device by this button.

### 2. To setup the other devices

#### Copy current settings as a new setup URI

You can copy the current settings as a new setup URI. And this URI can be used to setup the other devices as [Use the copied setup URI](#use-the-copied-setup-uri).

### 3. Reset

#### Discard existing settings and databases

Reset the Self-hosted LiveSync settings and databases.

### 3. Compatibility (Database structure)

#### (Obsolete) Use an old adapter for compatibility (obsolete)

Setting key: useIndexedDBAdapter
Before v0.17.16, we used an old adapter for the local database. Now the new adapter is preferred. However, it needs local database rebuilding. Please disable this toggle when you have enough time. If leave it enabled, also while fetching from the remote database, you will be asked to disable this.

Restore or reconstruct local database from remote database but use local chunks.

### 4. Total Overhaul

#### Rebuild everything

Rebuild local and remote database with local files.
