### 0.19.0

#### Customization sync

Since `Plugin and their settings` have been broken, so I tried to fix it, not just fix it, but fix it the way it should be.

Now, we have `Customization sync`.

It is a real shame that the compatibility between these features has been broken. However, this new feature is surely useful and I believe that worth getting over the pain.
We can use the new feature with the same configuration. Only the menu on the command palette has been changed. The dialog can be opened by `Show customization sync dialog`.

I hope you will give it a try.
