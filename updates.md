### 0.16.0
- Now hidden files need not be scanned. Changes will be detected automatically.
  - If you want it to back to its previous behaviour, please disable `Monitor changes to internal files`.
  - Due to using an internal API, this feature may become unusable with a major update. If this happens, please disable this once.

#### Minors

- 0.16.1 Added missing log updates.
- 0.16.2 Fixed many problems caused by combinations of `Sync On Save` and the tracking logic that changed at 0.15.6.
- 0.16.3
  - Fixed detection of IBM Cloudant (And if there are some issues, be fixed automatically).
  - A configuration information reporting tool has been implemented.
- 0.16.4 Fixed detection failure. Please set the `Chunk size` again when using a self-hosted database.
- 0.16.5
  - Fixed
    - Conflict detection and merging now be able to treat deleted files.
    - Logs while the boot-up sequence has been tidied up.
    - Fixed incorrect log entries.
  - New Feature
    - The feature of automatically deleting old expired metadata has been implemented.
    We can configure it in `Delete old metadata of deleted files on start-up` in the `General Settings` pane.
- 0.16.6
  - Fixed
    - Automatic (temporary) batch size adjustment has been restored to work correctly.
    - Chunk splitting has been backed to the previous behaviour for saving them correctly.
  - Improved
    - Corrupted chunks will be detected automatically.
    - Now on the case-insensitive system, `aaa.md` and `AAA.md` will be treated as the same file or path at applying changesets.
- 0.16.7 Nothing has been changed except toolsets, framework library, and as like them. Please inform me if something had been getting strange!
- 0.16.8 Now we can synchronise without `bad_request:invalid UTF-8 JSON` even while end-to-end encryption has been disabled.

Note:
Before 0.16.5, LiveSync had some issues making chunks. In this case, synchronisation had became been always failing after a corrupted one should be made. After 0.16.6, the corrupted chunk is automatically detected. Sorry for troubling you but please do `rebuild everything` when this plug-in notified so.
