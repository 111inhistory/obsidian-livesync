### 0.22.0
A few years passed since Self-hosted LiveSync was born, and our codebase had been very complicated. This could be patient now, but it should be a tremendous hurt.
Therefore at v0.22.0, for future maintainability, I refined task scheduling logic totally.

Of course, I think this would be our suffering in some cases. However, I would love to ask you for your cooperation and contribution.

Sorry for being absent so much long. And thank you for your patience!

Note: we got a very performance improvement.
