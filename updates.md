### 0.23.0
Incredibly new features!

Now, we can use object storage (MinIO, S3, R2 or anything you like) for synchronising! Moreover, despite that, we can use all the features as if we were using CouchDB.
Note: As this is a pretty experimental feature, hence we have some limitations.
- This is built on the append-only architecture. It will not shrink used storage if we do not perform a rebuild.
- A bit fragile. However, our version x.yy.0 is always so.
- When the first synchronisation, the entire history to date is transferred. For this reason, it is preferable to do this under the WiFi network.
- Do not worry, from the second synchronisation, we always transfer only differences.

I hope this feature empowers users to maintain independence and self-host their data, offering an alternative for those who prefer to manage their own storage solutions and avoid being stuck on the right side of a sudden change in business model.

Of course, I use Self-hosted MinIO for testing and recommend this. It is for the same reason as using CouchDB. -- open, controllable, auditable and indeed already audited by numerous eyes.

Let me write one more acknowledgement.

I have a lot of respect for that plugin, even though it is sometimes treated as if it is a competitor, remotely-save. I think it is a great architecture that embodies a different approach to my approach of recreating history. This time, with all due respect, I have used some of its code as a reference.
Hooray for open source, and generous licences, and the sharing of knowledge by experts.
