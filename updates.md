## 0.24.0 RC Release Note

**Note:** This will be rewritten with the stable release. I confess, before you take the time, this is quite long.

Over the past three years since the inception of the plugin, various features have been implemented to address diverse user needs. This is so honourable and I am grateful for your years of support.
However, However, this process has resulted in a codebase that has become increasingly disorganised, with features becoming entangled.

Consequently, this has led to a situation where bugs can go unnoticed or resolving one issue may inadvertently introduce another.

In 0.24.0, I reorganised the previously disjointed main codebase into clearly defined modules. Although I anticipated that the overall volume of code would not increase, I discovered that it has, in fact, expanded. While the complexity may still be considerable, the refactoring has enhanced clarity regarding the current structure of the code. (The next focus may involve a review of dependencies).

Throughout this process, a significant number of bugs have been resolved. And it may be worth mentioning that these bugs may had given rise to other bugs. I kindly request that you verify whether your issues have been addressed. At least conflict resolution and related issues have improved significantly.

It is also the first step towards a fully-fledged-fancy LiveSync, not just a plug-in from Obsidian. Of course, it will still be a plug-in as a first class and foremost, but this development marks a significant step towards the self-hosting concept.

This dev release is very close to the beta version that I had previously indicated would not be released. As a result, I have faced challenges in maintaining the main branch while working on this dev release. Regrettably, I have not been able to make any commits to the main branch in the last three weeks. Thus, the dev branch will remain reserved for major changes only.

The Release Candidate will be available for a few days and will only be officially released once users, including myself, have confirmed that there are no issues.

Finally, I would like to once again express my respect and gratitude to all of you once again. Thank you for your interest in the development version. Your contributions and dedication are greatly appreciated through testing.

Thank you, and I hope your troubles will be resolved!
